# CrystalGAT-An-AI-based-intelligent-flexible-crystal-materials-design-computing-platform
This study addresses the issue of serendipity in the discovery of flexible functional crystals. We developed an artificial intelligence platform named CrystalGAT, which employs graph attention neural networks to efficiently predict the mechanical properties of molecular crystals. Using CrystalGAT, we successfully identified key structural fragments influencing mechanical properties, achieving two major breakthroughs: (1) transforming brittle crystals into flexible light-responsive crystals; (2) Rapidly screening plastic cocrystals that enhance tablet compression performance. In summary, CrystalGAT provides a powerful tool for the rational design of flexible molecular crystals, offering broad application prospects in material discovery and drug modification. The platform is publicly accessible via its website for user convenience: https://huggingface.co/spaces/ZZZCCCYYY/CrystalGAT.
