# CrystalGAT-An-AI-based-intelligent-flexible-crystal-materials-design-computing-platform
This study addresses the issue of serendipity in the discovery of flexible functional crystals. We developed an artificial intelligence platform named CrystalGAT, which employs graph attention neural networks to efficiently predict the mechanical properties of molecular crystals. Using CrystalGAT, we successfully identified key structural fragments influencing mechanical properties, achieving two major breakthroughs: (1) transforming brittle crystals into flexible light-responsive crystals; (2) Rapidly screening plastic cocrystals that enhance tablet compression performance. In summary, CrystalGAT provides a powerful tool for the rational design of flexible molecular crystals, offering broad application prospects in material discovery and drug modification. The platform is publicly accessible via its website for user convenience: https://huggingface.co/spaces/ZZZCCCYYY/CrystalGAT.


## üìò Overview

This code corresponds to the main model used in our paper:

> Zhao, C. et al. *CrystalGAT: An AI-based intelligent flexible crystal materials design computing platform*, 2025.

CrystalGAT serves as the core deep learning model, while six other baseline models (GCN, MLP, RF, SVM, Transformer, XGBoost) are implemented for comparison.

Importance.py provides a simplified framework for using Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to analyze molecular structures represented by SMILES strings.
The model identifies important functional groups or atomic environments that contribute significantly to the classification results.
