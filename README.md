# CrystalGAT-An-AI-based-intelligent-flexible-crystal-materials-design-computing-platform
This study addresses the issue of serendipity in the discovery of flexible functional crystals. We developed an artificial intelligence platform named CrystalGAT, which employs graph attention neural networks to efficiently predict the mechanical properties of molecular crystals.
